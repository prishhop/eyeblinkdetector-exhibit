# eyeblinkdetector-exhibit
This project is a real-time eye blink detection system developed for exhibition purposes. Using OpenCV and facial landmark detection, it tracks eye movements through a webcam feed to count blinks and detect drowsiness or attention levels.

Features:

Real-time eye tracking with computer vision

Blink counting and detection

Works with standard webcam (no extra hardware)

Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Developed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how computer vision can be used for behavioral and safety applications.
